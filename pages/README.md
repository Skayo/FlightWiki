# README

## Introduction

This is a simple [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) project to show how to use the [Flight](https://flightphp.com) PHP micro-framework.

It uses files for the individual pages, so no database!  
Every page is a file in the pages directory, in root folder.  
All files have `.md` as the file extension and are using the [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

> _WARNING! This project is only an illustration of a development on the [Flight](https://flightphp.com) PHP micro-framework and is not intended to be used in a production environment! I'm not reliable for any damage that could be caused._

## How it works

Before any page creation, please make sure you have write privilege on the `/pages` folder:
```
$ chmod 755 ./pages
```

By default, you have these 4 pages on the Wiki: 

* [[ Home ]]
	* _This is the Home page, it contains links to this readme and two examples pages._
* [[ Another page ]] & [[ My new page ]]
	* _Just some example pages_
* [[ README ]]
	* _Some instructions for this little Wiki_  ‚Üê  You are here right now!
